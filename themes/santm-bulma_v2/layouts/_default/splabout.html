          <p>This <a href="http://santm.com">domain</a> is a self sponsored birthday üéÅ. Registered on Friday the 13th. Honestly, I did not know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskaidekaphobia">paraskevidekatriaphobia or triskaidekaphobia </a>those days it was just a weekend for me. Still remember the late rainy afternoon in Pleasanton, C.A. when I worked briefly for <a href="https://www.quest.com/foglight/">Quest/Foglight</a>.</p>

          <p>With global pandemic, working from home. Got some free time in the lockdown. And that is when came to know about Hugo content generator. It was again a new learning to understand how to migrate from Google Blogspot. But looks like it is not that difficult at all.  </p>
          <p>Now back to static hosting with <a href="https://gohugo.io" alt="Go Hugo">Hugo</a> . The theme is a simple, minimalistic & responsive build on <a href="https://bulma.io" alt="Bulma Framework">Bulma</a> framework made by me. The hosting now moved to <a href="https://github.org">GitHub</a> pages.</p>

There are lots of challenge in migrating services and that always causes many part of the website not to be perfect. But this gives me real life problem to be solved.  I learned a lot in the that process.
